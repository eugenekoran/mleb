3. Ensure the test suite passes.
4. Make sure your code lints.
5. Issue that pull request!

## Report bugs using Github's [issues](https://github.com/eugenekoran/mleb/issues)

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/eugenekoran/mleb/issues/new); it's that easy!

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code

The more information you provide, the easier it will be to resolve the issue.

## Use a Consistent Coding Style
